# Movie Recommender System

## Why I Created This Project
I believe the best way to truly learn something is by **building it myself**. That’s why I created this repository: to build a **Movie Recommender System** while learning **Machine Learning** and **Recommender Systems** step by step.

I started this project on **November 19, 2025**. At this point, I only have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts and know that recommender systems are widely used on platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon.

This repo is my **learning journey**. I aim to:
- Learn **Collaborative Filtering**, **Content-Based Filtering**, and **Hybrid models**.
- Document **daily progress, challenges, and solutions** in this file so others can learn from my experience.
- Gradually build a **fully functional hybrid recommender system** that predicts and suggests movies.

Even if I miss some days, I will continue documenting and coding as consistently as possible.
